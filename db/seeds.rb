# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# These might end up being similar to the posts that appear on the live website,
# but of course, these are just dummy data that is dumped into local dev to make development
# more convenient. I figure that adding so much dummy data makes it easier for me to test
# different levels of nesting posts.
